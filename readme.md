### How To Run
I wrote this assignment in a Windows development environment. To run the code, open your CMD and navigate to the current working directory (i.e., the directory in which this README file is stored).

Then, you can run the following script to activate the Python virtual environment:

.venv\Scripts\activate

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should be able to open and run Assignment.py.

### Notes
If I were to remake this solution, I would place greater emphasis on performance instead of focusing solely on correctness.
