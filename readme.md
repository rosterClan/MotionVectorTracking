  </a>
</div>

## About The Project
This is an assignment in which we needed to track the motion of an on-screen actor and superimpose a vector motion map onto the video. The actor in this case was a dancing monkey in front of a blue screen.

Running the provided code will process the pre-extracted frames of the original video and superimpose the aforementioned vectors, producing the `finalExport.mp4` output file. An example of what the code produces is included below.

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting this project locally. Clone this repo and then perform the following steps. 

### Prerequisites
1: Clone the repo

2: I wrote this assignment in a Windows development environment. To run the code, open your CMD and navigate to the current working directory (i.e., the directory in which this README file is stored). Then, you can run the following script to activate the Python virtual environment:
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should be able to open and run Assignment.py.
