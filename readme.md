### What is this?
This is an assignment in which we needed to track the motion of an on-screen actor and superimpose a vector motion map onto the video. The actor in this case was a dancing monkey in front of a blue screen.

Running the provided code will process the pre-extracted frames of the original video and superimpose the aforementioned vectors, producing the `finalExport.mp4` output file. An example of what the code produces is included below.

##### Example Output

### How To Run
I wrote this assignment in a Windows development environment. To run the code, open your CMD and navigate to the current working directory (i.e., the directory in which this README file is stored).

Then, you can run the following script to activate the Python virtual environment:

.venv\Scripts\activate

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should be able to open and run Assignment.py.

### Example Output

### Notes
If I were to remake this solution, I would place greater emphasis on performance instead of focusing solely on correctness.
